Research and Usage Notice

Shunyaya Structural Origin Mathematics (SSOM) is a deterministic, origin-level structural framework 
for revealing the reliability posture of mathematical constructions at the moment they come into existence.

SSOM is provided for:
• foundational research
• mathematical and structural analysis
• reliability and boundary studies
• explainability
• educational and academic use

SSOM is not:
• a solver
• an optimizer
• a predictor
• a learning system
• a decision-making authority
• a governance or enforcement layer
• a safety-certified or production control system

SSOM does not intervene in computation.
It reveals structure and collapses exactly to classical meaning.

Any operational, commercial, or safety-critical use is undertaken entirely at the user’s own responsibility and is not permitted under this license.
