# ⭐ Shunyaya Structural Origin Mathematics (SSOM)

## Quickstart

**Deterministic • Origin-Level Structure • Collapse-Safe • Reliability Visibility • Reproducible Proofs**

---

## WHAT YOU NEED

Shunyaya Structural Origin Mathematics (SSOM) is intentionally minimal, foundational, and non-interventional.

### Requirements

- Python 3.9+
- Standard library only (no external dependencies)

Everything is:

- deterministic
- offline
- reproducible
- identical across machines

No randomness.  
No training.  
No probabilistic heuristics.  
No adaptive tuning.

### Notes

- These two trace folders are included as the **minimal audited showcase traces** for SSOM.
- The **complete set of trace folders (all tests)** is preserved unchanged inside the `evidence` bundle.

## NOTES ON STRUCTURE

- Each test is **append-only and deterministic**
- Each script exposes **structural posture**, not outcomes
- No solver is modified
- No classical computation is altered
- Outputs differ **only in structural observables**

---

## WHY SSOM MATTERS (FOUNDATIONAL VIEW)

Many mathematical failures are not wrong mathematics.

They are:

**correct mathematics relied upon beyond its structural reliability horizon.**

Classical mathematics answers:

> “Is the result correct?”

SSOM answers:

> “Is this construction structurally fit to exist here?”

---

## ONE-MINUTE MENTAL MODEL

Classical mathematics asks:

> “What is the value?”

Calculus asks:

> “How does the value change?”

SSOM asks:

> “What is the structural posture of this construction at birth?”

SSOM never intervenes.  
SSOM never optimizes.  
SSOM never governs.

It reveals structure, then collapses.

---

## CORE STRUCTURAL IDEA (IN ONE LINE)

Every mathematical object originates as a structural state  
and collapses exactly to its classical value.

---

## THE STRUCTURAL OBJECT (FROZEN DEFINITION)

SSOM attaches a structural triple to every mathematical construction:

`(m, a, s)`

Where:

- `m` = classical magnitude (unchanged)
- `a` = alignment lane (local structural posture)
- `s` = structural resistance (accumulated strain)

Mandatory exact collapse:

`phi((m, a, s)) = m`

Classical mathematics is never modified.

---

## WHAT SSOM OBSERVES

SSOM observes structure **before execution**:

- Limits → posture of approach
- Derivatives → posture of refinement
- Integrals → posture of accumulation

SSOM distinguishes behaviors that classical results cannot:

- calm vs oscillatory approach to the same limit
- calm derivative value vs violent neighborhood refinement
- equal integrals vs unequal accumulation strain

---

## STRUCTURAL RELIABILITY HORIZON

Across limits, derivatives, and integrals, SSOM identifies a boundary:

A point where:

- classical values remain correct
- structural posture degrades
- reliance becomes unsafe under a strict policy

This boundary is the **Structural Reliability Horizon**.

The horizon governs trust, not correctness.

Collapse remains exact everywhere:

`phi((m, a, s)) = m`

---

## DETERMINISTIC AND NON-INTERVENTIONAL

SSOM is:

- deterministic
- solver-independent
- reproducible
- collapse-safe
- observational only

SSOM introduces:

- no approximation
- no learning
- no optimization
- no prediction
- no governance

---

## WHAT SSOM IS — AND IS NOT

### What SSOM Is

- a structural origin layer for mathematics
- a reliability visibility framework for calculus
- a conservative bridge between correctness and trust

### What SSOM Is Not

SSOM is not:

- a solver
- an optimizer
- a convergence trick
- a decision engine
- a governance layer

SSOM reveals structure.  
Other layers may govern.

---

## QUICK RUN (ANY TEST)

Run any SSOM test script directly from the project root:

`python scripts/ssom_test1a_derivative_sqrt0.py`

Other examples:

`python scripts/ssom_test1b_derivative_x2sin1x_at0.py`  
`python scripts/ssom_test_a3_limit_path_posture.py`  
`python scripts/ssom_test_a4_integral_equal_area.py`  
`python scripts/ssom_test_a5_integral_cancellation.py`  
`python scripts/ssom_test_a6_derivative_refinement_fatigue_cos.py`  
`python scripts/ssom_test_a7_derivative_stiffness_exp.py`  
`python scripts/ssom_test_a9_derivative_geometry_invariance.py`

This produces:

- a deterministic structural trace
- an explicit reliability horizon
- unchanged classical values

No configuration required.

## ONE-LINE SUMMARY

Shunyaya Structural Origin Mathematics makes mathematical reliability visible at the moment of origin — without altering a single classical result.
